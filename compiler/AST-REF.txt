Notes:
======
1. The Function node is turned into a Lambda with a Return in the explicate phase.
2. The Lambda node is turned into a Lambda with a Stmt([Return(...)]) in explicate.
3. The P3Declassify phase has to introduce the InjectFrom node to convert a class
   into the appropriate runtime calls.  This means all subsequent phases have to 
   handle this node.
4. GCFlattener needs to turn Lambda nodes into Lambda with a Stmt([Return(...)])
   because the expression is flattened at this point.   To prevent explicate from
   doing the same thing, we pass handleLambdas="False" to the constructor for 
   P3Explicate
